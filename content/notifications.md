## Alerts when a note needs your help

Notes have the most impact when they get rated quickly and start showing on Tweets early. To ensure contributors don't miss the opportunity to rate notes on Tweets getting a lot of attention, Community Notes sends alerts requesting help from time to time.

If you are a contributor, you'll see these alerts in your notifications tab. They look like this:

{{< figure src="../images/alerts-tab.png" alt="Screenshot of a mobile device showing the Twitter app's Notifications screen. A new notification at the top reads: ”Community Notes needs your help! Your rating can help determine if this note should be shown on a Tweet that's getting a lot of attention.”">}}

To learn more about how Community Notes decides which notes trigger these alerts, see [Under the Hood – Needs Your Help](./timeline-tabs.md)

### Notification settings

The default setting for all contributors is "Often", which means you'll start by getting a few alerts per week. You can change that frequency by visiting your Community Notes profile and tapping the gear icon on the top right, or by clicking the button below:

{{< figure src="../images/alerts-settings.png" alt="Two side-by-side screenshots of mobiles devices showing the Twitter app. The first one shows a Community Notes Contributor profile page, highlighting the settings button on the top right. The second one reads: Community Notes settings. Alerts when a note needs help: Receive notifications when a Community Note needs your rating. Options: I'm all in. As many as I can help with — up to a few per day. Often — a few alerts per week. Sometimes — A few alerts per month. Never”">}}

## Other notifications

Contributors also receive notifications with status updates about the notes they've written and rated. At this time these are not configurable, but we plan to add more controls in the future.
