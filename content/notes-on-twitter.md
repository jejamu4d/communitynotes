When browsing Twitter on Android, iOS, or at Twitter.com, Birdwatch pilot participants may see cards on Tweets that have Birdwatch notes. Birdwatch cards may include a specific Birdwatch note or reference the number of Birdwatch notes on the Tweet, and link to the Birdwatch site where contributors can rate the notes.

### Cards showing a specific note

If a Tweet has a Birdwatch note deemed **Currently rated helpful** by contributors then the note content will be shown in the card, along with a button to rate the note. If the Tweet has multiple notes with **Currently rated helpful** status, the card will show one note, randomly cycling between them at periodic intervals in order to gather additional rating inputs on each.

The one exception to this is if a **Currently rated helpful** note deems the Tweet **Not misleading**. In this case, since the Tweet was considered not misleading, the note will not be shown on the Tweet.

### Cards showing a count of notes

If a Tweet has notes but none yet have **Currently rated helpful** status, the card will show the number of notes, and allow people to tap to read and rate those notes on the Birdwatch site.

If all notes on a Tweet have **Currently not rated helpful** status, no card will be shown. Pilot participants will still be able to access these notes via the Birdwatch icon displayed in the Tweet details page.
