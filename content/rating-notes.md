Ratings help identify which notes are helpful enough to show on Twitter and notes that are not helpful and should not be shown.

## Rating notes on the Community Notes site

Go to the [**Community Notes Home page**](https://communitynotes.twitter.com) and choose any Tweet to see notes that contributors have added to it. There are three main timelines on this page:

- **Needs your help:** Contains Tweets with notes where you can have the most impact when rating. This tab is only visible to Community Notes contributors.

- **New:** Contains Tweets with the most recent notes.

- **Rated Helpful:** Contains Tweets with at least one note rated helpful by the community.

{{< figure src="../images/home.png" alt="Two side-by-side mockups of the Twitter app, in desktop and mobile versions. Both show the Community Notes home page. The header reads ”Community Notes”. The screen presents three tabs: Needs your help (selected), Rated Helpful, and New. The title of the selected tab reads: ”Rate these notes chosen for you. Notes on these Tweets need a more diverse range of feedback, and your point of view could help decide if they're helpful. This list refreshes regularly.” The list displays two Tweets that have prompts on them, each reading ”Help rate proposed Community Notes on this Tweet”.">}}

## Rating notes on Twitter

Community Notes contributors and people on Twitter may also see notes and prompts in their timeline when browsing Twitter.

{{< figure src="../images/notes-on-twitter.png" alt="Two side-by-side mockups of the Twitter mobile app. Both show the same Tweet by Kian @naturelvr49: ”Whales are not actually mammals. If Humans (land mammals) can't drink seawater – just try it! – how can supposed sea mammals like whales stay hydrated?” On the first mockup, the Tweet has a Community Notes Prompt on it, reading: ”Help rate proposed Community Notes on this Tweet – Only visible to Community Notes contributors”. The second mockup shows the Tweet with a. Community Note applied to it. The note reads: Readers added context they thought people might want to know: Whales are indeed mammals. marine mammals are able to “stay hydrated” because their kidneys have evolved to excrete more salt + reclaim more water than humans and many other mammals can. They also obtain water from their food. This is widely documented, for example in http://reputable... Is this note helpful? Rate it">}}
