Community Notes' goal is to show helpful context to people when they come across potentially misleading information on Twitter. When a note is rated Helpful by contributors, it starts being shown directly on the Tweet. Here's how they show up:

If Humans (land mammals) can't drink seawater – just try it! – how can supposed sea mammals like whales stay hydrated? Readers added context they thought people might want to know: Whales are indeed mammals. marine mammals are able to “stay hydrated” because their kidneys have evolved to excrete more salt + reclaim more water than humans and many other mammals can. They also obtain water from their food. This is widely documented, for example in http://reputable... Is this note helpful? Rate it">}}

## How do notes start showing on Twitter?

All proposed notes start with the status of **Needs More Ratings**, and are shown to Contributors in order to gather ratings.

If you are a Community Notes contributor, you'll see a prompt on Tweets that have proposed notes. Tap the prompt to rate those notes.

If Humans (land mammals) can't drink seawater – just try it! – how can supposed sea mammals like whales stay hydrated? Prompt reads: Help rate proposed Community Notes on this Tweet. Only visible to Community Notes contributors">}}

If enough contributors from [different points of view](../diversity) rate a note as **helpful**, it earns a status of "Helpful", and starts showing on Twitter.

If enough contributors rate a note as **not helpful**, it reaches a status of "Not Helpful", and is not shown on Twitter. Contributors whose notes consistently reach this status may have their [writing ability temporarily locked](../writing-ability).

{{< figure src="../images/note-statuses.png" alt="Mockup showing a stack of three community notes in different statuses. The first one has a status of ”Note is currently rated helpful · Cites reliable sources · Easy to understand”, the second has a status of ”Note needs more ratings” and the third has a status of ”Note is currently not rated helpful · Sources missing or unreliable · Argumentative”">}}

Note statuses are updated as new ratings come in, so notes may show on Twitter and then disappear. Statuses are locked after 2 weeks.
