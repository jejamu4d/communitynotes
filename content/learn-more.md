## Birdwatch is a collaborative way to add helpful context to Tweets and keep people better informed

Birdwatch is a pilot program that aims to create a better-informed world. This is done by empowering people on Twitter to collaboratively add helpful notes to Tweets that might be misleading.

### Contributors write and rate notes

Contributors are people on Twitter, just like you, who chose to enroll in the pilot to write and rate notes. The more people that participate, the better the program becomes. You can sign up here.

### Only notes that people find helpful appear on a Tweet

In order to be shown publicly as context on the Tweet, a note needs to be rated helpful by enough people from different points of view. This approach helps avoid bias and manipulation, and helps find notes that are helpful to many people.

### Twitter doesn’t choose what shows up, the people do

Twitter doesn’t write, rate or moderate notes (unless they break the Twitter rules.) We believe giving people voice to make these choices together is a fair and effective way to add information that helps people stay better informed.

## Frequently asked questions

### How does a Tweet get a note?

Contributors can suggest a note on any Tweet. Notes are then rated for helpfulness by other contributors. Notes are only shown on Tweets if they are rated helpful by enough people from different perspectives (having rated things differently in the past).

### How does Birdwatch prevent abuse?

Birdwatch works differently than the rest of Twitter — it’s not a popularity contest. It aims to find notes that many people from different points of view will find helpful. It takes into account not only how many ratings a note has received, but also whether people who rated it helpful seem to come from different perspectives (having rated things differently in the past). Because notes need to genuinely be found helpful by people who tend to disagree, Birdwatch is more likely to identify notes that many people find helpful. Read the full details of [how this works](../ranking-notes/).

Notes are also subject to Twitter rules and can be reported.

### Can regular people really be trusted to do this?

We believe regular people can valuably contribute to identifying and adding helpful context to potentially misleading information. Many of the internet’s existing collaborative sites thrive with the help of non-expert contributions — Wikipedia, for example — and research has shown the potential of a crowdsourced based approach to addressing misleading information on the internet, for example:

- Study 1
- Study 2
- Study 3

In our pilot test of Birdwatch, we’ve also seen that:

- The majority of people surveyed on Twitter find Birdwatch notes (somewhat or extremely) helpful — and this includes people from across the political spectrum.
- Notes are informative: people are 20-40% less likely to agree with the substance of a Tweet after reading the note about it
- In review by professional fact-checkers, inaccuracies in notes that have been rated "helpful" are rare.

The people on Twitter span a wide gamut of backgrounds and experiences, and we believe that, working together, they can help create a better-informed world.

### I have a note on my Tweet. What can I do?

As a Tweet author, if you disagree that a Birdwatch note provides important context about your Tweet, you can request an [additional review](../additional-review/).
