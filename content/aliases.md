We want everyone to feel comfortable contributing to Community Notes. Aliases let contributors write and rate notes without sharing their Twitter usernames.

A Community Notes alias is a new, auto-generated display name that contributors get when they join Community Notes. Aliases are not publicly associated with contributors’ Twitter accounts, so everyone can write and rate notes privately.

Further, we believe aliases have the potential to:

- **Reduce bias**. By keeping focus on the content of notes rather than who’s writing them, aliases have the potential to reduce bias that people might have around specific authors.
- **Reduce polarization**. [Recent research](https://twitter.com/chris_bail/status/1379453587558952960?s=20) indicates aliases might reduce polarization by helping people feel comfortable crossing partisan lines, or criticizing their own side without the prospect of peer pressure or retribution.

### Accountability

It’s important that the benefits of aliases don’t come at the expense of accountability. To that end: all Community Notes accounts have profile pages that make it easy to see one’s past contributions and their [Writing and Rating Impact](../impact). Additionally, Community Notes contributors are [accountable to ratings their contributions receive](https://twitter.com/communitynotes/status/1404519791394758657), giving weight to contributors whose notes and ratings are consistently found helpful by others.

## How to choose your alias

Contributors can visit [this link](https://twitter.com/i/communitynotes/u/me) to choose an alias. You'll have 5 random options to pick from, and at this time choices cannot be changed.

List of options: Smart Carrot Finch, Joyous Book Sparrow, Friendly Cup Finch, Warm Candle Hawk, Joyous Mountain Skylark. Primary button: Confirm.

## Contributor profiles

With aliases, every contributor gets a public profile. On this page, everyone can see the notes people have written in the past, as well as their [Writing and Rating Impact](../impact). We'll continue to add information and evolve the profile pages as we learn more about what's important to contributors when using Community Notes.

Don't hesitate to [send us feedback](http://twitter.com/communitynotes) at any time.
